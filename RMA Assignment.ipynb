    "**Welcome to 'RMA Prediction' assignment, Below is a brief background:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Return merchandise authorization (RMA) is the process of returning a product to receive a refund, replacement, or repair during the product's warranty period. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the chip manufacturing industry, in particular, the manufacturers have an interest in detect these units before it being shipped and reach the market for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The cost of a single unit during production is nil, compared to replacing an entire end device that causes several times more damage\n",
    "\n",
    "- The damage done to a company's reputation when a new device is returned as bad one can be very significant\n",
    "\n",
    "- A malfunctioning unit can cause significant damage (you don't want such bad unit placed in ABS system of your car :) )\n",
    "\n",
    "There are detailed test programs in which thousands of tests are performed on chips during production to ensure quality and prevent such cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "RMA units means units that have passed all test cycles properly, and yet have been found to be defective in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The manufacturers are aware that there are such units and their goal is to predict which units will be malfunctioning soon even though they now appear to be working properly. Once predicting such units, they will mark them as bad and not ship them to customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This use case is called \"RMA Prediction\" and this is the challenge you are required to deal with in this assignment!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please follow the steps in this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please write all your code inside this notebook only\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please feel free to add more cells as you need\n",
    "\n",
    "- The goal of this assigment is not only the best model:\n",
    "    - there is also value in clean code, and in orderly and clear work\n",
    "    - Use visualizations and comments on the reasons for the actions you take\n",
    "    - It is recommended to show in the notebook also experiments you tried along the way\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid over-fitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Your prediction results will be tested on a test set that is not available to you\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Good Luck!"
